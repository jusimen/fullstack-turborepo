# Full-Stack Monorepo Starter Kit

This is a monorepo starter kit for full-stack applications. It uses [Pnpm Workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) to manage dependencies and [Turborepo](https://turborepo.com/) to manage the monorepo.

For the frontend, it uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
For the backend, it uses [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/).
Also included are [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) to manipulate the database.

The goal of this project is to provide a full-stack monorepo starter kit that is easy to use and easy to understand and that can be used as a starting point for any full-stack project.
